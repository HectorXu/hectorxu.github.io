	<h1>Narrative Visualization ï¼šComparison of GDP between China and the United States </h1>
	<p>The GDP growth trend of the top 10 countries in the past 62 years using current US$. The line graph shows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>x-axis is time line over the past 62 years from 1960 to 2021. </li>
		<li>y-axis is the total GDP(current US$) as courrent USD for both United States and China.</li>
	</ul>
	<svg width=1500 height=500></svg>
	<p> Judging from the total GDP in the past two decades, as shown in line graph, the two indicators of China and
		United States are gradually increasing, and the overall growth rate of China is greater than that of
		United States, so the gap between the two is gradually narrowing. Specifically, China's GDP has grown from
		US$1,211 billion in 2000 to US$17,734 billion, an increase of 12 to 15 times, with an average annual growth
		rate of over 7%. The GDP of the United States has increased from US$10,252 billion in 2000 to US$22,996
		billion. Although the growth rate is not large, it maintains an average annual level of 2%-3%, but its base is
		large. </p>
	<p> It can be seen that the gap between China and United States has gradually narrowed to almost the same
		in total, and it is expected to surpass the United States in the future. But on average, China has a large
		population, which is not only the reason for promoting economic development, but also the driving
		force for GDP to catch up with United States, but also the reason for the low per capita level. The trend of
		the GDP growth of the two countries is largely consistent, such as the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007,
		the economic downturn, and the GDP growth rate of the two countries has maintained a slow decline after 2010,
		Among them, in 2020, due to the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, the GDP growth rates of both
		countries have dropped sharply. This shows that the economies of two major powers in the same world environment
		are mutually influenced, and this influence is a zero-sum game. One prospers and one loses, the other will
		inevitably be adversely affected.</p>
