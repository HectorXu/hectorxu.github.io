	<p> Among the top ten countries in terms of global GDP, it can be clearly seen that the United
		States is far ahead all the way, and Japan has grown significantly in the early 1990s and has remained second in
		the world. The Asian financial crisis at the end of the last century has caused Japan's GDP to stagnate until
		now. At the same time, with China's reform and opening up, China's GDP began to maintain rapid growth around
		2000, rapidly surpassing other countries' GDP. Around 2010, China's GDP surpassed Japan's, ranking second in the
		world, and gradually approaching the United States. Other countries maintained steady growth, and the GDP of
		China and the United States far exceeded that of other countries.</p>
